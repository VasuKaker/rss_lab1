Is but a dream within a dream.
You are not wrong, who deem
Grains of the golden sand--
All that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?Of a surf-tormented shore,
Grains of the golden sand--
Through my fingers to the deep,
O God! can I not save
Is it therefore the less gone?
Is all that we see or seem
Take this kiss upon the brow!
In a night, or in a day,
How few! yet how they creep
Is it therefore the less gone?
Them with a tighter clasp?

And I hold within my hand
O God! can I not grasp
I stand amid the roar
O God! can I not save
Of a surf-tormented shore,
How few! yet how they creep
Is all that we see or seem
One from the pitiless wave?

Through my fingers to the deep,
Them with a tighter clasp?
That my days have been a dream;
In a vision, or in none,
Yet if hope has flown away
