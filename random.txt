Grains of the golden sand--
In a night, or in a day,
Is all that we see or seem
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Is all that we see or seem
Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Is it therefore the less gone?
That my days have been a dream;
All that we see or seem
Thus much let me avow--
And, in parting from you now,
O God! can I not save
All that we see or seem
Thus much let me avow--
One from the pitiless wave?
How few! yet how they creep
Thus much let me avow--
And I hold within my hand
But a dream within a dream?
Is it therefore the less gone?
Is it therefore the less gone?
In a vision, or in none,
In a vision, or in none,
And I hold within my hand
Is it therefore the less gone?
Is all that we see or seem

Thus much let me avow--
Is it therefore the less gone?
O God! can I not grasp
