Thus much let me avow--
All that we see or seem
I stand amid the roar
I stand amid the roar
I stand amid the roar
All that we see or seem

Is but a dream within a dream.
And, in parting from you now,
Through my fingers to the deep,
Of a surf-tormented shore,
O God! can I not grasp
I stand amid the roar
O God! can I not save
Of a surf-tormented shore,
How few! yet how they creep
Is all that we see or seem
One from the pitiless wave?

Through my fingers to the deep,
Them with a tighter clasp?
That my days have been a dream;
In a vision, or in none,
Yet if hope has flown away
