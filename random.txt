Grains of the golden sand--
In a night, or in a day,
Is all that we see or seem
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Is all that we see or seem
Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Is it therefore the less gone?
That my days have been a dream;
All that we see or seem
Thus much let me avow--
